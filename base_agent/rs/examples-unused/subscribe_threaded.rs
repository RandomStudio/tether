//! # Subscribe on one thread
//!
//! This example demonstrates checking for messages repeatedly on a separate, spawned thread.
//! If any messages are found, it will relay them to the other (main) thread via an
//! async Channel.
//!
//! To keep this example reasonably realistic, the message-checking thread loops more quickly
//! (1ms interval) while the main thread simulates being very busy with other things (1 second
//! interval).
//!
//! When the main thread comes to a non-empty "queue" of messages on the Receiver, it processes
//! them as quickly as possible. Once it has received at least 10 messages, it simply quits.
//!
//! **This example needs some published messages to be useful!** Try running the publish example
//! at the same time: `cargo run --example publish`
