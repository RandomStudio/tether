//! # Publish and Subscribe on separate threads
//!
//! Demonstrates checking for messages on one (spawned) thread while publishing messages on another
//! thread (in this, case the main thread). The main thread loops exactly `publish_count_target times`,
//! while the spawned thread - the one checking for messages - loops "inifitely".
//!
//! You may notice that the CHECKING LOOP occasionally throws an error from try_lock: this is
//! because both threads may attempt to access (lock) the reference to the Tether Agent at the same
//! time. This is **not** a problem because the CHECKING LOOP will simply find another opportunity to
//! check the messages again later.
//!
//! When the program ends, you should see `publish_count_target times` messages published and the same
//! number received, proving that nothing was "lost" between the threads and no deadlock situations
//! occurred.
